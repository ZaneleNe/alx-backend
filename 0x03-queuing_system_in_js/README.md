Queuing System in JS Documentation
Introduction This document provides a step-by-step guide on setting up a Redis instance and integrating it with your queuing system in JavaScript. It includes instructions on downloading, compiling, and running Redis, as well as managing Redis data for your project.

Requirements GitHub repository: alx-backend Directory: 0x03-queuing_system_in_js Files: README.md, dump.rdb Installation and Setup

Download and Compile Redis Follow these commands to download, extract, and compile Redis version 6.0.10:
sh Copy code

Download Redis
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz

Extract the tarball
tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz

Change to the Redis directory
cd redis-6.0.10

Compile Redis
make 2. Start Redis Server Start the Redis server in the background:

sh Copy code src/redis-server & 3. Verify Redis Server is Running Use the Redis CLI to send a PING command to the server:

sh Copy code src/redis-cli ping You should see the response: PONG

Set and Get a Key-Value Pair Set the value "School" for the key "Holberton" using the Redis CLI:
sh Copy code src/redis-cli set Holberton School You should see the response: OK

Retrieve the value for the key "Holberton":

sh Copy code src/redis-cli get Holberton You should see the response: "School"

Kill the Redis Server Find the process ID (PID) of the Redis server and kill it:
sh Copy code

List the running processes and filter for redis-server
ps aux | grep redis-server Identify the PID and kill the process:

sh Copy code kill [PID_OF_Redis_Server] 6. Copy dump.rdb to the Project Directory Locate the dump.rdb file in the redis-6.0.10 directory and copy it to the root of your queuing project:

sh Copy code

Assuming you're in the redis-6.0.10 directory
cp dump.rdb /path/to/your/queuing_project_root/ 7. Verify the Setup To ensure everything is set up correctly, restart the Redis server and check if the key "Holberton" still returns "School":

sh Copy code

Start Redis server again
src/redis-server &

Verify the key-value pair
src/redis-cli get Holberton You should see the response: "School"

Update Your Repository Finally, make sure to update your repository with the necessary files:
sh Copy code

Change to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/queuing_project_root/

Add the dump.rdb file
git add dump.rdb

Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add Redis dump file"

Push the changes
git push Conclusion By following these steps, you should have a fully functioning Redis setup and the dump.rdb file in your project repository as required. This setup ensures that the key "Holberton" will return the value "School" when queried.
